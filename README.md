<h2>What I learned</h2>
While working on this assignment I learned a lot about additive styling and rewritting/overriding default styling values from Frameworks/plugins. At one point I was completely lost but I'm glad that I pushed through and was able to complete this! I'm eager to learn more about what bootstap has to offer and how I can use it to better the projects that I make in the future!
